# Julia Learning Materials

Here I am keeping a bunch of notes, projects, and resources for learning Julia.

In the notebooks folder you will see a bunch of julia files which can be open with Pluto.jl.

In static folder you will see a bunch of html files which can be opened without installing Pluto.jl. They can just be opened by clicking on them when you clone the repo.
